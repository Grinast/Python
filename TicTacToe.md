# Tic Tac Toe simulator

Homework of the EdX course [Using Python for Research](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+PH526x+1T2018/course/)

## Description

The program simulates tic tac toes games of Player 1 vs Player 2.

Two game modes are available: _random_ and _strategic_.

In a _random game_, each player puts a mark (1 or 2) in a random empty cell (0).\
In a _strategic game_, player 1 puts a mark in the middle cell as a first move, then the game proceeds randomly.

10000 games are simulated to compare the two strategies and the winning rate of each player.

No winner (draw): -1\
Player 1 wins: 1\
Player 2 wins: 2
